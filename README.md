## Salem State Computer Science Department Website
#### Redesigned and written by Damian Barrous-Dume

The current CS Department website here at Salem State is outdated and not responsive, so I have done a redesign. The redesign of the Computer Science Department's website is powered by ReactJS on the front-end and by Node on the back end. It looks modern, as well as responsive. It is accessible, as well.
